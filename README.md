# Info Covid Tracker

**&ast;&ast;Update&ast;&ast;
 Last March 10, 2023, the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center ceased its collecting and reporting of global COVID-19 data. The data will no longer be updated and this website's function such as searching for COVID 19 cases of each individual country no longer works. üôÅ**

This website is an updated version of [this one.](https://github.com/AdmiralFirefox/info-covid-corner) It   tracks all information related to COVID-19. The data updates from time to time depending on the COVID-19 API.

**[You can visit the live site here.](https://info-covid-tracker.vercel.app/)**

**Built using [covid19api](https://covid19api.com/)**

<br />

## Features

- Tracks **confirmed cases**, **deaths**, **recovered**, **new confirmed**, **new deaths**, and **new recovered** globally.

- Tracks **confirmed cases**, **deaths**, **recovered**, **new confirmed**, **new deaths**, and **new recovered** of each country and displayed through a table.

- The table can sort by ascending and descending order on each columns (either alphabetically or by values). You can also filter the values.

- Can search for a specific country's COVID-19 information like **confirmed cases**, **deaths**, **recovered** and **active cases**

- Also when searching for a country, it displays a line chart for tracking a country's **confirmed cases**, **deaths** and **active cases** in the past few days, as well as the **new cases**, **new deaths** and **new active cases** every day.
